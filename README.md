## What's this?

This repo is a mirror of the [examples folder](https://github.com/withastro/astro/tree/main/examples) of the [Astro](https://astro.build) project. By having the examples in a separate repo, downloading the examples is much faster due to not having to download the entire Astro project.

**Do not open issues or PRs here.** If you have an issue with an example, please open an issue in the [Astro repo](https://github.com/withastro/astro).
